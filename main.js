Multiple of 4 and 7.

if any number is input, it will check all of the whole integers smaller than the number given and check
if the number is a multiple of 4 or 7 and add all of them.

If number is both a multiple of 4 and 7, only add it once

Negative numbers should return 0.

    if (currNum % 4 === 0 || currNum % 7 === 0) sum += currNum;
